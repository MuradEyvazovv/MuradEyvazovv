## About me ##

Hi, I‚Äôm **Murad Eyvazov**, a Computer Engineering student at UMass Boston.  
I‚Äôm passionate about **AI**, **machine learning**, and building tech solutions that solve real-world problems.  
Currently, I‚Äôm sharpening my skills in Python programming, machine learning, data analysis, and model evaluation skills, and I thrive on contributing to open-source projects while continuously exploring new technologies.

## üíº Projects

- [define-solve-mlproblem]( https://github.com/MuradEyvazovv/My-Cornell-Portfolio )  
  A full ML pipeline to predict ‚ÄúDelivery Quality‚Äù from the World Happiness Report data (data cleaning, EDA, model training & comparison, feature‚Äêimportance visualization).

- [rsa-cryptosystem](https://github.com/MuradEyvazovv/RSA-Cryptosystem)  
  Educational RSA cryptosystem in Python with simple CLI tools for key generation, encryption (to fixed-width binary), and decryption back to plaintext. Built for learning‚Äîuses small primes and naive methods, so not production-secure.

- [eight-puzzle-board]( https://github.com/MuradEyvazovv/Eight-Puzzle-Board )  
  A Java data type for the 8-Puzzle game:  
  - Implements Hamming & Manhattan heuristics  
  - Checks solvability  
  - Generates neighbor boards  
  - Includes unit tests via `main()`
